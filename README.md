# talkback-assistant
Ary is a voice-controlled TalkBack assistant built with Python. It listens to your voice, answers questions from a local database, tells the time, cracks jokes, and even learns new info you teach it. Features include speech recognition, text-to-speech, SQLite storage, and fun interactive responses.

### “Built as a school project, loved by all – now finally on GitHub.”

## 📜 About This Project
I built this project two years ago as my 12th board Computer Science final project, centered around Python and SQL. It turned out to be the most appreciated project in my school that year.
Back then, I had no idea what GitHub was, so I'm sharing it now to inspire others.
